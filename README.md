# Learn to code - Tutorial 2
Excellent. Now we have source control in-place we can move onto the next important step. Setting up an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). There are many-many-many IDE's out there, from fully featured like [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to notepad and your CLI (command-line interface).
Given it's early days, we'll stick with free products - and you can't go past Microsoft's [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's so good, I'm waiting for Jetbrains and the rest to start their anti-competition lawsuit.

We might as well introduce [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) while we are at it. Node is a open-source platform written in [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). We could go down and explain each term I bring up, but I'll leave it to you to do some home-study if you want. For now, just consider Javascript as one of many available programming lanugages out there, its main features being - [interpretted not compiled](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs98si/slides/overview.html), no [type safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety), and is the most common language found for client-side webpage programming and can even manage server-side behaviour too!

NodeJS provides us a great [asynchronous, event-driven javascript runtime](https://nodejs.org/en/about/), and we will be using it implement our project.

*Note: There are 2 steps for this tutorial, these cover both the IDE and Javascript components respectively*

### Step 1 - IDE
* Install an your IDE of choice

### Done criteria 
* Open this project in your IDE

### Help! 
 I recommend VS Code for ease-of-use, although I personally use IntelliJ IDEA. Don't forget, all this coding can be done from text-based editors like [sublime-text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), notepad, textpad, or if you are familiar with your CLI - [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)

========

### Step 2 - Install NodeJS
* Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Install the [Node package manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### Done criteria
* Check node is installed by first navigating to your project directory using your CLI of choice (Powertools, CMD, terminal, iterm...)
* Type `node` and you should see something like this
```
% node
Welcome to Node.js v18.0.0.
Type ".help" for more information.

### Help!
 I've provided links in some of the steps that'll take you to a 'getting started' page or 'download' page for that step. Rather than copying or going-over the same material, these pages explain how to setup each tool quite well.
