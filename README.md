# Learn to code - Tutorial 1
A introduction to programming and the common tools you need to make your coding life a bit easier.
The basic idea will be to iteratively complete each part, building towards a larger more fully functional piece of software. This approach will reinforce clean coding principles as you move from coding solutions to software design.

## Step 1 - Source control
Git is an incredibly useful piece of open-source software that enables you to implement version control for your project. There are online services like Github that offer free accounts where you can create repositories, commit and push code to them and share changes for peer review. As such, I recommend giving git and github a bit of a read when you can.

As google is life, I'm not going to give you explicit instructions, but I am giving you the logical steps you'd need to take to get things done.

### Keywords
*Git, github, source control, repositories, fork, branch, commit, push*

### Steps
1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) 
2. Create an account on [github](https://github.com/)
3. Fork this repository
4. Download your fork
5. Create a branch called 'tutorial-1' off main
6. Push your branch to Github

### Done criteria
* You need to send me the URL of your forked repo.

### What is git?

**git** is a command-line version control system. It consists of **commits** that chain together to form the history of your code.
What is unique about **git** is it's implementation of **branches** which are copies of your code (including **commit** history) from where you branched off from.
You can work on these **branches** independently of one another, and then **merge** them back into a **main** branch when ready.

 ## Next tutorial
 For the next tutorial, you need to change the current branch you are on [main] to [tutorial-2].
